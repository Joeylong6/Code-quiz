## Your Task 

To build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.


## What Problems Did I Run Into

I tried to dynamically bring in the highScores page which was a mistake. I got overwhelmed from the very start of this homework and found myself overcomplicating the process. I am handing in a half-cooked Quiz but I really did try my best. I feel very deflated by the whole process but will try and get it working once I have had some time away from it. I need to let it be for now.
